# docker-b3
Docker image accompanying a paper on Bayesian data analysis.

Install Docker, give it plenty of RAM/CPU and run:

```docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -v "`pwd`":/home/rstudio/working -e PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD -e ROOT=TRUE torkar/docker-b3```

then fire up the browser and point it to localhost:8787 and use `rstudio` as username and the password your set above.

**Note:** Exchange YOUR_PASSWORD to a password for you.

## Where to start?

If you are interested in ...

* The code for our **re-analysis**, read the `Reanalysis_Report.html` file.
* Checking and changing our code, open `Reanalysis_Script.R`. We recommend creating an [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/) project.
* Exploring other models and getting more details on the BDA workflow, open `brms.R`.
